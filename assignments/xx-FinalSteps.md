# Write a complete java program

Your goal is to write a complete java program with a main that will test a couple of other functions.

Codingbat does not teach you to write a complete program, instead it helps you automatically test your functions with premade test cases.

You will now create a class that has any math/science formula you like. You will then create two arrays, one with input values, and the other with the expected values.
