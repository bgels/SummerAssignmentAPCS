# Enough codingbat

Codingbat does not teach you to write a complete program, instead it helps you automatically test your functions with premade test cases.

# Write a complete java program

Your goal is to write a complete java program with a main that will test a couple of other functions.

* create a class in a file named `Tester.java` and include the main method.
* create a secondary function which can be any math/science formula you like.
* In your main: create two arrays, one with input values, and the other with the expected values.
* DO NOT use your function to generate the expected values, you need to know them ahead of time, either with a calculator, or because they are well known values. 
* Run your function on the input values, and see if the match the expected values, print pass/fail depending if the values match or not.
